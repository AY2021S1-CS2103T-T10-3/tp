## **Introduction**

For more information on the ChopChop application itself, read the [_User Guide_](UserGuide.md) instead.

This developer guide specifies the design architecture and details some of the software design decisions in the implementation of the ChopChop application. It is intended to be read by contributors, testers, and future maintainers.

## **Setting Up**

To setup the development environment, refer to [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

-------------
## **Design**

This section of the developer guide details the overall design of ChopChop, including the various subcomponents and how they fit together.

### Component Architecture

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" /> <br />
Figure 1: <i>The architecture diagram of ChopChop</i>
</div>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* During launch: initialising the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other.
* During shutdown: shutting down the components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App broadly consists of these four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The user interface (UI).
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): The in-memory data manager.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): The on-disk data manager.

Each of these components:
* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class, implementing the corresponding `interface`.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements said interface.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete recipe #1`:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" /> <br />
Figure 2: <i>A sequence diagram showing the execution of <code>delete recipe #1</code></i>
</div>


The following sections break down the various components in greater detail.




----------------
### UI Component

The *UI* component is responsible for all the user-facing views in the graphical user interface. This includes displaying recipes and ingredients, receiving command input from the user, and printing command results to the user.

The class diagram of the UI component is shown below:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" /> <br />
Figure 3: <i>The class diagram of the UI component</i>
</div>

**Interface**: [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`HelpWindow`, `PinBox`, `CommandOutput`, `DisplayController`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The graphical user interface is built using the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.





-------------------
### Logic Component

The *Logic* component is responsible for parsing command input, executing commands, and updating the Model component of any changes to data caused by running a command.

The class diagram of the Logic component is shown below:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" /> <br />
Figure 4: <i>The class diagram of the Logic component</i>
</div>

**Interface**: [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/logic/Logic.java)

This is the general flow of events when a command is executed:
1. `Logic` uses its `CommandParser` to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.
1. After command execution, the command is saved by the `HistoryManager` to keep track of command history, and to allow for undoing/redoing of commands.

For example, this is a sequence diagram showing the deletion of a recipe:
<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" /> <br />
Figure 5: <i>A sequence diagram showing the execution of <code>delete recipe #1</code> in the Logic component</i>
</div>










-------------------
### Model Component

The *Model* component is responsible for holding the data of the application (eg. the recipes and ingredients) in-memory during execution, and mediating access to this data for each of the other components of the system.

The class diagram of the *Model* component is shown below:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" /> <br />
Figure 6: <i>The class diagram of the Model component</i>
</div>

**Interface**: [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/model/Model.java)

The Model component:
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores the recipe and ingredient book data.
* Exposes an `ObservableList` of both `Recipe` and `Ingredient`, for UI component to observe and update its graphical interface.


Of note in the Model component are the `Recipe` and `Ingredient` classes; below is the class diagram for both:
<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<h2 style="background-color: pink">TODO: class diagram for Recipe and Ingredient</h2>
Figure 7: <i>The class diagram for Recipes and Ingredients</i>
</div>

Note that an instance of `Recipe` only stores `IngredientReferences` to the ingredients it uses, and not the actual `Ingredients` themselves â€” since the actual instance of the ingredient that will be used by the recipe is indeterminate.

Only when a recipe is made are the references are resolved to their actual ingredient.



---------------------
### Storage Component

The storage component is responsible for the saving and loading of both the user preferences, and more importantly the recipe and ingredient data, to and from disk. Both pieces of data are stored in Javascript Object Notation (JSON) files, which is a human-readable (and editable) plain-text format.

Currently, the Jackson library is used for (de)serialisation.

The class diagram of the *Storage* component is shown below:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png"> <br />
Figure 8: <i>The class diagram of the Storage component</i>
</div>

**Interface**: [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/storage/Storage.java)

As mentioned above, the `Storage` component:
* Saves and loads `UserPref`.
* Saves and loads the *Recipe Book* and the *Ingredient Book*.

Each entity (eg. `Recipe`, `IngredientSet`) that needs to be saved has a corresponding `JsonAdapted{X}` class in the `chopchop.storage` package. This adapter class is responsible for converting, using Jackson, the 'normal' objects to a string representation (or to another adapter class), and to convert this string representation back to a 'normal' object.

For example, the `Ingredient` class has a corresponding `JsonAdaptedIngredient` that saves and loads the ingredient's name, quantities, and expiry dates.



------------------
### Utility Classes

While not itself a component, various utility types are placed in the `chopchop.commons` package; these are used by all the components in ChopChop, and comprise three sub-parts in their respective packages:

1. `core` contains classes to handle GUI settings, logging, and versioning.
2. `exceptions` contains exception types common across ChopChop.
3. `util` contains utility classes for file IO and argument validation, as well as functional types.









-----------------------------
## **Implementation Details**

This section explains, in detail, the implemenation of some noteworthy features.


### Command Parser

Main developer: **zhiayang**

The command parser is part of the *Logic* component, and is responsible for taking the input command as a string and either returning a valid `Command` to be executed, or a sensible error message.

Shown below is the class diagram for the various Parser components:
<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<h2 style="background-color: pink">TODO: class diagram for Parser stuff</h2>
Figure 9: <i>The class diagram for the parser</i>
</div>

Notably, there are various wrapper classes to ensure type safety, namely `ArgName`, `CommandArguments`, and `ItemReference`, used instead of passing raw strings around in an error-prone manner.

Furthermore, instead of pointlessly instantiating objects that do not store any state, all of the parsing work (save the main `CommandParser`) is done by static methods, in the various `_CommandParser` classes (eg. `AddCommandParser`, `ListCommandParser`).




One of the more complex commands to parse is the `add recipe` command; here is the sequence diagram detailing how it is parsed:
<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<h2 style="background-color: pink">TODO: sequence diagram for <code>add recipe</code></h2>

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialised with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
