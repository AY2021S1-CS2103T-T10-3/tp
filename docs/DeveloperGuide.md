## **Introduction**

For more information on the ChopChop application itself, read the [_User Guide_](UserGuide.md) instead.

This developer guide specifies the design architecture and details some of the software design decisions in the implementation of the ChopChop application. It is intended to be read by contributors, testers, and future maintainers.

## **Setting Up**

To setup the development environment, refer to [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

-------------
## **Design**

This section of the developer guide details the overall design of ChopChop, including the various subcomponents and how they fit together.

### Component Architecture

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" /> <br />
Figure 1: <i>The architecture diagram of ChopChop</i>
</div>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* During launch: initialising the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other.
* During shutdown: shutting down the components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App broadly consists of these four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The user interface (UI).
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): The in-memory data manager.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): The on-disk data manager.

Each of these components:
* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class, implementing the corresponding `interface`.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements said interface.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete recipe #1`:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" /> <br />
Figure 2: <i>A sequence diagram showing the execution of <code>delete recipe #1</code></i>
</div>


The following sections break down the various components in greater detail.




----------------
### UI Component

The *UI* component is responsible for all the user-facing views in the graphical user interface. This includes displaying recipes and ingredients, receiving command input from the user, and printing command results to the user.

The class diagram of the UI component is shown below:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" /> <br />
Figure 3: <i>The class diagram of the UI component</i>
</div>

**Interface**: [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`HelpWindow`, `PinBox`, `CommandOutput`, `DisplayController`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The graphical user interface is built using the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.





-------------------
### Logic Component

The *Logic* component is responsible for parsing command input, executing commands, and updating the Model component of any changes to data caused by running a command.

The class diagram of the Logic component is shown below:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" /> <br />
Figure 4: <i>The class diagram of the Logic component</i>
</div>

**Interface**: [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/logic/Logic.java)

This is the general flow of events when a command is executed:
1. `Logic` uses its `CommandParser` to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.
1. After command execution, the command is saved by the `HistoryManager` to keep track of command history, and to allow for undoing/redoing of commands.

For example, this is a sequence diagram showing the deletion of a recipe:
<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" /> <br />
Figure 5: <i>A sequence diagram showing the execution of <code>delete recipe #1</code> in the Logic component</i>
</div>










-------------------
### Model Component

The *Model* component is responsible for holding the data of the application (eg. the recipes and ingredients) in-memory during execution, and mediating access to this data for each of the other components of the system.

The class diagram of the *Model* component is shown below:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" /> <br />
Figure 6: <i>The class diagram of the Model component</i>
</div>

**Interface**: [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/model/Model.java)

The Model component:
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores the recipe and ingredient book data.
* Exposes an `ObservableList` of both `Recipe` and `Ingredient`, for UI component to observe and update its graphical interface.


Of note in the Model component are the `Recipe` and `Ingredient` classes; below is the class diagram for both:
<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<h2 style="background-color: pink">TODO: class diagram for Recipe and Ingredient</h2>
Figure 7: <i>The class diagram for Recipes and Ingredients</i>
</div>

Note that an instance of `Recipe` only stores `IngredientReferences` to the ingredients it uses, and not the actual `Ingredients` themselves â€” since the actual instance of the ingredient that will be used by the recipe is indeterminate.

Only when a recipe is made are the references are resolved to their actual ingredient.



---------------------
### Storage Component

The storage component is responsible for the saving and loading of the usage data for recipe and ingredient, the user preferences, and more importantly the recipe and ingredient data, to and from disk. Both pieces of data are stored in Javascript Object Notation (JSON) files, which is a human-readable (and editable) plain-text format.

Currently, the Jackson library is used for (de)serialisation.

The class diagram of the *Storage* component is shown below:

<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png"> <br />
Figure 8: <i>The class diagram of the Storage component</i>
</div>

**Interface**: [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/chopchop/storage/Storage.java)

As mentioned above, the `Storage` component:
* Saves and loads `UserPref`.
* Saves and loads the *Recipe Book* and the *Ingredient Book*.
* Saves and loads the *Recipe Usage List* and the *Ingredient Usage List*.

Each component is saved in a separate file with its file path specified in UserPref.
Each entity (eg. `Recipe`, `IngredientSet`) that needs to be saved has a corresponding `JsonAdapted{X}` class in the `chopchop.storage` package. This adapter class is responsible for converting, using Jackson, the 'normal' objects to a string representation (or to another adapter class), and to convert this string representation back to a 'normal' object.

For example, the `Ingredient` class has a corresponding `JsonAdaptedIngredient` that saves and loads the ingredient's name, quantities, and expiry dates.
It can also be multi-level.
For example, the `JsonSerializableIngredientUsageList` contains `JsonAdaptedUsageList` and `JsonAdaptedUsageList` in turn contains a list of `JsonAdaptedIngredientUsage`.


------------------
### Utility Classes

While not itself a component, various utility types are placed in the `chopchop.commons` package; these are used by all the components in ChopChop, and comprise three sub-parts in their respective packages:

1. `core` contains classes to handle GUI settings, logging, and versioning.
2. `exceptions` contains exception types common across ChopChop.
3. `util` contains utility classes for file IO and argument validation, as well as functional types.









-----------------------------
## **Implementation Details**

This section explains, in detail, the implementation of some noteworthy features.


### Command Parser

Main developer: **zhiayang**

The command parser is part of the *Logic* component, and is responsible for taking the input command as a string and either returning a valid `Command` to be executed, or a sensible error message. It was completely rewritten due to the requirement of different parsing semantics.

Shown below is the class diagram for the various Parser components:
<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<h2 style="background-color: pink">TODO: class diagram for Parser stuff</h2>
Figure 9: <i>The class diagram for the parser</i>
</div>

Notably, there are various wrapper classes to ensure type safety, namely `CommandArguments`, `ArgName`, and `ItemReference`, used instead of passing raw strings around in an error-prone manner.

Furthermore, instead of pointlessly instantiating objects that do not store any state, all of the parsing work (save the main `CommandParser`) is done by static methods, in the various `_CommandParser` classes (eg. `AddCommandParser`, `ListCommandParser`).

One of the more complex commands to parse is the `add recipe` command; here is the sequence diagram detailing how it is parsed:
<div style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2em">
<h2 style="background-color: pink">TODO: sequence diagram for <code>add recipe</code></h2>
Figure 10: <i>A sequence diagram for parsing an <code>add recipe</code> command</i>
</div>


<h4>Design Considerations</h4>
**1. Use of exceptions**

The parser written in an exception-free manner, using monadic result types (`Result`, `Optional`) instead.
  - Option A: use exceptions
    - Pros: easier interfacing with the rest of ChopChop and existing AB3 code
    - Cons: harder to visualise error source and propagation
  - **Option B (chosen)**: use monadic types
    - Pros: more explicit, easier to visualise error source and propagation
    - Cons: harder to write

**2. Numbered vs named item references**

ChopChop allows referring to items (recipes and ingredients) both by their full name, as well as by its index number (as in AB3).

  - Option A: allow only numbers
    - Pros: easier to implement
    - Cons: less intuitive for the user, index number can change as views are updated
  - Option B: allow only names
    - Pros: easier to implement
    - Cons: full name of the ingredient or recipe might be tedious to type out each time
  - **Option C (chosen)**: allow both
    - Pros: best of both worlds
    - Cons: slightly more code to implement

<h2 style="background-color: #1077ff">TODO: stuff below isn't done</h2>


### Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo feature is implemented using a `HistoryManager`, which keeps track of and stores the command history, along with a list of parsed undoable `Command`s.
Every command that can be undone/redone implements the `Undoable` interface, which requires the implementation of the `Undoable#undo()` method.
Optionally, the command can implement the `Undoable#redo()` method to customise the default behaviour, which is to re-execute the command.
The `HistoryManager` then implements the following operations:

* `HistoryManager#addInput()` â€” Saves the command history of the last input entered
* `HistoryManager#addCommand()` â€” Saves the last parsed command (if it is undoable)
* `HistoryManager#undo()` â€” Undo the last `Undoable` command
* `HistoryManager#redo()` â€” Redo the last `Undoable` command

The `HistoryManager#undo()` and `HistoryManager#redo()` methods move the current command history pointer and carries out the requested operation.
Further details can be seen in the example usage scenario detailing the mechanism below.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `HistoryManager` is initialised with an empty list of `CommandHistory`s, as no commands have been entered, and the `currentIndex` pointer is intialised to 0.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete recipe #5` to delete the 5th recipe from the recipe book.
The model is updated accordingly, and the `DeleteRecipeCommand` is saved by the `HistoryManager` by adding to the `CommandHistory` list, as the command implements the `Undoable` interface.
The `currentIndex` pointer is also incremented by one, as the application is currently at the state after the `DeleteRecipeCommand` is executed.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add recipe beef noodles` to add a new recipe.
Similarly, the model is updated accordingly, and the `AddRecipeCommand` is added to the `CommandHistory` list.
The `currentIndex` pointer is once again incremented by one.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

Step 4. The user now desires to undo the last action, and executes the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `HistoryManager#undo()`, which will decrement the `currentIndex` pointer by one and retrieve the command from the list at the specified index.
The command's `Undoable#undo()` operation will then be executed.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `HistoryManager#redo()`, which executes the command `currentIndex` is pointing to, and increments the `currentIndex` by one.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list recipes`.
Commands that do not modify the model, such as `list recipes`, will not be stored by the `HistoryManager` as they cannot be undone.
Since the `currentIndex` is not pointing to the end of the `CommandHistory` list, all commands starting from the `currentIndex` will be cleared, which in this case is the `add recipe beef noodles` command.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save each undoable command as it is executed. Each command implements its own undo/redo operation.
  * Pros: Uses less memory since the entire state of the application does not have to be saved, and is also faster since only a small part of the model needs to be modified each time.
  * Cons: All model changes need to be restricted to the command, as each command needs to be able to fully reverse any changes made to the model.

* **Alternative 2:** Saves the entire recipe/ingredient book every time a change is made to the model.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, does not require custom undo/redo operations for each command.
  * Cons: Will be much slower as the entire model needs to be replaced on each undo/redo, which does not scale well with more recipes/ingredients.
